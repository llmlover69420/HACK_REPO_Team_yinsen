'The usual functions of the OpenAI API that you might need to create a multi-agent system with long-term memory and tool usage include:  \n\n1. **Text Completion**: Generate text based on prompts to assist agents in conversation or task execution.  \n2. **Text Embedding**: Create embeddings for long-term memory storage and retrieval of relevant information.  \n3. **Fine-tuning**: Customize models for specific tasks or behaviors of agents in the system.  \n4. **Chat API**: Facilitate interactive conversations between agents and users.  \n5. **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Implement mechanisms to store and retrieve past interactions or learned information for long-term memory.  \n6. **Tool Integration**: Enable agents to call external tools or APIs to perform specific tasks or gather information.  \n7. **Multi-agent Coordination**: Functions to manage communication and task distribution between multiple agents.  \n8. **Feedback Loop**: Mechanisms to learn from interactions and improve agent responses over time.  \n\nThese functions can help in building a robust multi-agent system that can remember past interactions and utilize various tools effectively.'
